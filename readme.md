This project illustrates how can you use SQL query builder
to produce a powerful queries with ease. To use this project
you'll have to install 2 things:

1. DSQL library
2. Download and import "emplayees" database.

Emploees database is official MySQL test-data as explained here:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/


Installation:
-------------

Clone repository locally, then use Composer to install dependencies.
(http://getcomposer.org)

copy config-example.php into config.php and replace values to
connect to your local "employees" database.

Usage
-----

From the command-line execute:

    $ php query-demo1.php

Similarly you can execute other examples.

Each example contains a very basic code, so feel free to open
and tweak files

Extending
---------

Why not add your own example? Try creating your own queries and once
you are successful, contribute your example into the suite. Try to
extract some meaningful results from the database and produce
queries that demonstrate power of DSQL.
